# GUI-Project1
First Project in GUI - 2. Semester

# What was the purpose?
I was supposed to create a App, which emulates Ship traffic, where the user can send out ships (with cargo) and take in ships.

# What did I learn?
It was the first big project in Java. I have learned how to use Threads, as I used them for the first time in a program. I also learned a bit about structuring a bigger project, but this is far from perfect.

# Result
I have got 14 out of 15 points for this project. The one point is missing, because I have not implemented a save/load system to save states and later load them in.
